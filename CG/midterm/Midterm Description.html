<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, you will implement the complete 2D pipeline as presented in class using routines written for previous assignments. This project is in lieu of a traditional midterm exam.</p>
<p>This assignment has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Test your knowledge of the components and algorithms of 2D drawing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine existing code into a complete graphics pipeline application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Programming Environment</h2>
<p>As with the previous assignments, the programming environment that you will use for this project is a set of simple modules with implementations in C, C++ and Python. You are free to use either of the implementations. The modules for the C/C++ version include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Buffers</code> - a support module providing OpenGL vertex and element buffer support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Canvas</code> - a simple 2D canvas that allows the ability to set a pixel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Pipeline</code> - the module containing the methods you must implement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ShaderSetup</code> - a support module that handles shader program compilation and linking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Vertex</code> - a module that describes the structure of a vertex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>midtermMain</code> - the main function for the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>shader.vert</code>, <code>shader.frag</code> - simple GLSL 1.50 shaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>alt.vert</code>, <code>alt.frag</code> - simple GLSL 1.20 shaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>alt.vert</code>, <code>alt.frag</code> - alternate GLSL shaders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The C version includes a module named <code>FloatVector</code> which provides an extensible vector holding floating-point values. Both versions include a file named <code>header.mak</code> for use with the <code>gmakemake</code> program on our systems to create a <code>Makefile</code> to simplify compilation and linking of the program.</p>
<p>The modules for the Python version are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif;">cg1canvas -</span> the module containing the methods you must implement</li>
<li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif;">simpleCanvas</span> - a simple 2D canvas that allows the ability to set a pixel.</li>
<li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif;">midtermMain</span> - the main function for the application</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Supplied Files&nbsp; section (below) for details on how to download the framework.</p>
<p>It is expected that you have working versions of the functions <code>drawPolygon()</code> and <code>clipPolygon()</code> which you wrote for previous assignments. It is particularly important that you have a working <code>drawPolygon()</code> as you will not be able to generate any output without it.</p>
<p>You may be able to drop your <code>Rasterizer</code> and <code>Clipper</code> modules from labs 2 and 3 into your solution directly with only minor changes. Remember that the lab 2 framework used integer coordinate values, while the lab 3 framework (and this project's framework) use floating-point coordinate values, so there may be some "tweaking" necessary in places.</p>
<p><strong> If you do not have a working version of <code>drawPolygon()</code>, </strong> there is a method within the <code>Canvas</code> /<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif;"> simpleCanvas</span> module named <code>drawOutline()</code> that you can use for the project. However, this routine will not fill in the polygon - it only draws the outline. <strong> You should only use this routine if you do not have a working version of the <code>drawPolygon()</code> method within your <code>Rasterizer</code>. </strong></p>
<p>You will need to perform matrix manipulations in your code. You are welcome to use auxiliary libraries from the Web for matrix manipulation (or alternately, you can write your own). See the Notes<em> </em><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/projects/protected/project1/#notes"><em></em></a>section (below) for links to some freely-available matrix packages.</p>
<h2>3. Routines to Implement</h2>
<p>The only provided module that you will need to modify is <code>Pipeline / cg1Canvas</code>. You will add your implementations of the methods in these module. You are free to expand this module by adding other methods and data members, as needed.</p>
<p>You will find the list of methods that must be implemented in the <code>Pipeline / cg1Canvas</code> declaration. The <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=661045&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-5405719" target="_self">midterm lecture notes</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=661045&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-5405720" target="_self">video</a> also describe these methods.</p>
<p>You are free to create any additional auxiliary modules or classes that you might need. However, you should not modify the code for <code>Canvas</code> or <code>midtermMain</code>. You are encouraged to re-use the <code>Rasterizer</code> and <code>Clipper</code> modules you developed in earlier assignments, or you may choose to re-implement those features for this assignment.</p>
<p>The test driver program runs four separate tests of your implementation: basic polygon drawing; use of a non-standard clip window; model transformations; and non-standard viewports. Its output should look much like these samples:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/projects/protected/project1/Screen1.png" width="208" height="200" border="0" />&nbsp; <img src="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/projects/protected/project1/Screen2.png" width="208" height="200" border="0" />&nbsp; <img src="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/projects/protected/project1/Screen3.png" width="208" height="200" border="0" />&nbsp; <img src="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/projects/protected/project1/Screen4.png" width="208" height="200" border="0" /></p>
<p>Tests can be selected by clicking the left mouse button, or through keyboard input. Each click of the mouse moves to the next test in sequence. The individual tests can be selected as follows: characters <code>P</code> and <code>1</code> select the basic polygon test, <code>C</code> and <code>2</code> select the clipping test, <code>T</code> and <code>3</code> select the transformation test, and <code>V</code> and <code>4</code> select the viewport test.</p>
<h2>4. Supplied Files</h2>
<p>The programming framework for this assignment is available as a ZIP archive.&nbsp; It can be found in the CONTENT-&gt;Exams-&gt;midterm area of mycourses or by clicking <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=661045&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=rochester-5405721" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>The ZIP archive contains a folder named <code>midterm</code>; under that are subfolders <code>c</code>, <code>c++</code>, <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">python</span>, and <code>misc</code>, which contain the obvious things. In the C and C++ folders you'll find a file named <code>header.mak</code>, for use on the CS systems to help you generate a <code>Makefile</code> that will compile and link your program with the libraries used by the framework. See the contents of <code>header.mak</code> for details on how to do this. The <code>misc</code> folder contains a shellscript named <code>compmac</code> which will compile and link the code on Mac systems.</p>
<h2>5. What to Submit</h2>
<p>You must submit your modified <code>Pipeline or cg1Canvas</code> file(s) along with any other supporting files you are using. You should also include a <code>README</code> file indicating the platform and language on which you tested your implementation as well as other explanatory info as you see fit. Do not submit the <code>Canvas</code> and <code>midtermMain</code> files.</p>
<p>If you are working in C++, your implementation must be in a file named <code>Pipeline.cpp</code>. If your implementation requires making changes to the <code>Pipeline.h</code> file (e.g., you have added data members or member functions to the class declaration), you should submit that file along with <code>Pipeline.cpp</code>. If you make changes to the <code>header.mak</code> file, you may submit your modified file as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are working in C, your implementation must be in a file named <code>Pipeline.c</code>. Again, if your implementation requires making changes to the <code>Pipeline.h</code> file, you should submit that file along with <code>Pipeline.c</code>. If you make changes to the <code>header.mak</code> file, you may submit your modified file as well.</p>
<p>If you are working in Python, you should submit the modified <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">cg1canvas.py</span> file.</p>
<p>If you are using one of the matrix libraries described below, please do not submit it. If you are working in C, the GSL libraries are installed on the CS systems, and the <code>header.mak</code> file automatically links against that library.</p>
<p>For C++, if you are using the Matrix TCL Pro package, the three files <code>cmatrix</code>, <code>matrix.cc</code>, and <code>matrix2.hxx</code> files will be in the working directory, and you should use the following statement to include them in your code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#include "cmatrix"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are using GLM, include the main GLM header file this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#include &lt;glm/glm.hpp&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or, if you prefer, you may include individual GLM header files by functionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#include &lt;glm/vec3.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;glm/mat3.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;glm/matrix.hpp&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>etc. If you are using an external matrix library <strong>other than</strong> the ones described in the Notes section (below), <strong>or</strong> you are using a modified version of one of those libraries, you must submit those files with your submission. Make sure that the matrix library files are included directly from the working directory.</p>
<p>Note that the numPy python package does include support for matrix operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; That package is already required for past assignments.&nbsp; If you use another Python package, please indicate which in your README and include all necessary files.</p>
<p>The minimum acceptance test is that your code must be complete - that is, it must compile and link cleanly when submitted. Submissions <em>will not be accepted</em> if they fail to compile and link cleanly. (Warning messages from the compiler are acceptable, but not fatal errors.)</p>
<p>Submissions should be made via mycourses to the Dropbox named <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=661045&amp;type=dropbox&amp;rcode=rochester-5405723" target="_self">Midterm</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Grading</h2>
<p>Your submission will be graded out of 100 points, and will earn points as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 points for submitting code that compiles, runs, and produces a window.</li>
<li>20 points for basic polygon drawing
<ul>
<li><em>Note: reduced to 8 points</em> if you are using the supplied <code>drawOutline()</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>20 points for model transformations</li>
<li>20 points for non-standard clipping</li>
<li>20 points for non-standard viewport</li>
<li>10 points for style and documentation</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Notes</h2>
<p>You are welcome to use auxiliary libraries from the Web for matrix manipulation (or alternately, you can write your own). There are several good libraries available for these languages; here are the ones we recommend, as all three are available on the CS lab machines (of course, you are free to use whatever library you like, as long as it is freely available).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>C: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/"> The GNU Scientific Library</a></p>
<p>GSL version 2.1 is installed on the CS lab machines; the <code>header.mak</code> supplied with the framework is set up to automatically link your code using this library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++: <a href="http://www.techsoftpl.com/matrix/"> Matrix TCL Pro</a></p>
<p>Matrix TCL Pro version 2.2 is available in the course account on the CS systems, in the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/lib/matclpro/"><code>~cscix10/lib/matclpro</code></a> directory. To use it, copy the three files from the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/lib/matclpro/include/"> <code>~cscix10/lib/matclpro/include</code></a> directory into your working directory, and include the <code>cmatrix</code> file using the <code>#include</code> format shown in the What to Submit&nbsp; section (above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++: <a href="http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/">GLM</a></p>
<p>GLM 0.9.7.2 is installed on the CS lab machines; for greatest compatibility, you may wish to install that version on your own system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience, archive files for the Matrix TCL Pro 2.2 and GLM 0.9.7.2 can be found in the course account; see the directory <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/lib/archives/"><code>~cscix10/lib/archives</code></a> for these files.</p>
<p>For Python, matrix operations are available via the numPy package.</p>
<p>If you are using one of these libraries unmodified, please do not submit them along with your solutions; However, if you are using a modified version of one of these libraries or a different matrix library, you <strong>must</strong> submit your library along with your solution.</p>
<p>Don't wait until the last minute to submit things! You may, in fact, want to submit even a partially-working solution as you work on it - there is no penalty for making multiple submissions, and this will help ensure that you get <em>something</em> submitted for this assignment.</p>
<p>Do not make any changes to the function prototypes. This means that your implementations must match the prototypes exactly in terms of number, types, and order of parameters. The reason for this is that the test programs assume that your implementations match those prototypes; if you make changes, there will be compilation errors, and even if the test programs link, they almost certainly won't execute correctly (which means you'll lose substantial amounts of credit for incorrect program performance).</p>
<p>The <code>shader.vert</code> and <code>shader.frag</code> files supplied with the framework require GLSL version 1.50, which is only available with OpenGL 3.2 or newer. If you are attempting to develop your code on a system which doesn't have a new-enough version of GLSL, you'll get error messages when these files are compiled during the execution of your code. The driver program will automatically "fall back" to the alternate shaders if GLSL 1.50 isn't available.</p>
